# **Python Data Analytics Projects 📊🐍**  

This repository showcases various **Data Analytics projects** using **Python** to explore, analyze, and visualize data. Each project applies **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and insights generation** using real-world datasets.  

## **What I’m Doing 🚀**  
🔹 Analyzing structured datasets to uncover meaningful patterns  
🔹 Performing **data cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation**  
🔹 Visualizing insights using **Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly**  
🔹 Applying **statistical analysis and machine learning** where relevant  

## **Projects Included 📂**  
✅ **Spotify Music EDA** – Analyzing song trends, artist dominance, and audio features (done, check branches)
✅ **COVID-19 Impact Study** – Assessing economic and health data changes (working)
